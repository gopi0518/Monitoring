# Monitoring
Dynatrace-Confluent Platform-JMX
The Dynatrace-Confluent plugin is based on the JMX plugin and allows the 
Dynatrace OneAgent to collect JMX metrics from Confluent Components.

Note: Dynatrace Agent does not pull metrics with text value. So, I have used Synthetic HTTP   monitoring to check Connector Statuses.
